# MathParser

**#Overview**

This project is a Mathematical Expression Evaluator that takes user input in a natural language format (e.g., mul 3 sub 2 sum 1 3 4) and evaluates it step by step. The web application provides a clean and formal UI with step-by-step breakdowns of how the expression is computed.

**#Features**

**User Input Processing**: Users can enter a mathematical expression using words like sum, sub, mul, div.

**Real-time Evaluation**: Expressions are evaluated and results are displayed immediately.

**Step-by-Step Breakdow**n: Users can see how their expression is computed.

**Conclusion**

This project effectively demonstrates parsing, evaluating, and visualizing mathematical expressions in an easy-to-use web app. It is suitable for educational purposes, coding demonstrations, and further development into a more powerful computational tool.
